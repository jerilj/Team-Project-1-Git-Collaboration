# Software development tools and practices to improve productivity and competitiveness

The technological innovations in computer hardware and software changed the way companies do business. In order  to stay competitive at a global level, companies have to adopt the latest technologies faster than its competitors. For example, the delay in adopting e-commerce made companies like Walmart and Macy's lose their competitive advantage to Amazon. 

## Git
Developing large and complex software requires collaboration of multiple developers. A version control system like git will make it easier for multiple developers to work on one project and keep track of code changes, bugs, bug fixes, releases etc. This inturn helps the companies to lower the cost of software development.

## Docker
A version control system like git has a centralized repository. A developer usually creates a copy of this repository in his local machine to do the development. In large projects, it is impossible for every developer to have a local machine with the exact same system configurations and dependencies required to run the code from the repository. 

In order to solve this issue all the developers in the project had to emulate the same system configurations. Virtual machines were a popular choice for this until the introduction of Docker. Docker made it possible to emulate multiple linux environments on a machine by using less resources compared to virtual machines. A developer will create a docker container with the configuration specified in the project repository. The code will be developed and tested in that container.
