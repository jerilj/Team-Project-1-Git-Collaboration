# Software development tools and practices to improve productivity and competitiveness

The technological innovations in computer hardware and software changed the way companies do business. In order  to stay competitive at a global level, companies have to adopt the latest technologies faster than its competitors. For example, the delay in adopting e-commerce made companies like Walmart and Macy's lose their competitive advantage to Amazon. 

## Git
Developing large and complex software requires collaboration of multiple developers. A version control system like git will make it easier for multiple developers to work on one project and keep track of code changes, bugs, bug fixes, releases etc. This inturn helps the companies to lower the cost of software development.
