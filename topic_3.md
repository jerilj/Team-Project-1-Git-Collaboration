# Git commands and terminology:

## Merge
Merging  is Git's way of putting together a united history again. The git merge command allows you to take independent lines of development made by a git branch and merge it into a single branch.	

Example:- 
We have a new branch feature that is based off the master branch. We now want to merge this feature branch into master.
