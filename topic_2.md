# GitFlow Workflow 

Git is a version control system that helps developers to keep track of code changes. Development team uses git in different ways in their projects. Two of the popular branching models using git are GitFlow and Github Flow. GitFlow was introduced by Vicent Driessen in 2010. 

## Development
In GitFlow methodology, the git repository will have a develop branch that is branched off from the master branch tagged for a new release. The development team will create a feature branch from the develop branch for every new feature added to the software and for non-emergency bug-fixes. This will help the team to isolate new features that are under development from master and develop branches. Once the features are finished, they will be merged back into the develop branch.
